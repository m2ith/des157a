                <p>Music has always been a big part of my life especially when I was growing up. My parents would play music while my brother and I would be doing our own things but we would usually listen to music as a family a lot. Below you will find some prominent songs I listened to during my childhood and some memories I have associated with them.</p>

                <h2>Déjà Vu</h2>

                <p>While I do not have a prominent memory with this song, I had a huge sense of déjà vu when I was sitting in my Asian History class in community college. We were watching a documentary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square event where this song came up and I was overcome with a heavy sense of familiarity.</p>

                <p>I ended up going home that day and telling my dad about this. I showed him the part of the documentary where the song was playing and saying how familiar it was. It turns out he used to play that song often when I was really little.</p>

                <h2>The Ceiling</h2>

                <p>My parents would always play The Black Keys when I was growing up and a significant song I always remember hearing was "Gold on the Ceiling". My most prominent memory I recall whenever I hear this song is little me staring at the ceiling. The funny thing is that I always thought the song said "Hole on the Ceiling" so that is why I would always look at the ceiling to see if there was a hole whenever this song came on.</p>

                <h2>By The Countertop</h2>

                <p>One prominent memory I have with this song, is watching my parents cook from behind the bar countertop we used to have. It was always fun talking to them and watching them make dinner.</p>
