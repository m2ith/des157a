                <p class="text-entry">I thought the article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f" target="_blank"><em>Best Practices for Form Design</em></a> was a very insightful read. I learned more about better ways to design forms to increase user usage and better user experience. For instance, one thing that stood out to me was the inline labels and that it is best to not have the labels inside the input field but on top of then. This also applies to placeholder text which was really interesting to learn as I noticed for forms I have filled out before, follow these practices. I also thought the auto-focused input field section was really interesting as I never realized how important it is to guide the user to filling that part out first. I tend to fill the auto-focused input fields out because I subconsciously lean towards it first. Another aspect which I thought was very important was the tab ready section. It highlights the importance of accessibility and making the form inputs easy to navigate.</p>

                <p>An example website that I think explimifies these practices is <a href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank"><em>Webflow</em></a>, more specifically their invoice section under the billing section for one's website. For instance, the form displays labels above the input field with addition to providing support text next to those input fields to give users information on why Webflow needs/uses the information.</p>
