            <h2>Overlays Design Pattern</h2>
            <div class="entry">
                <p><strong>Date:</strong> <date class="date" datetime="2025-01-28">28 January 2025</date></p>
                <p class="text-entry">I found the article <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/" target="_blank"><em>Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</em></a> to be pretty informative. The article states how overlays and lightboxes are used purely for the designers convenience in order to avoid making a new page. It mentions how important it is to make overlays and lightboxes accessible to keyboard users by using the <emEscape></em> key to close it. It emphasizes when a designer is making an overlay, consider: who, what, when, where, and why?</p>

                <p><em>Who</em> is the target audience? <em>What</em> action is the user suppose to take? <em>When</em> will the overlay appear? <em>Where</em> will the overlay appear? <em>Why</em> does it need to be an overlay? I think these questions are really beneficial for designers to consider when they decide to create an overlay as it focuses on accessibility and making informed design decisions.</p>

                <p>I think it is very important to make sure to plan when to use an overlay and consider when it is better to make a new page. Additionally, the article states how important it is to make overlays accessible whether it is optimizing it for different devices or making it compatible with keyboard users.</p>

            <h2>Form Design</h2>
            <div class="entry">
                <p><strong>Date:</strong> <date class="date" datetime="2025-01-17">17 January 2025</date></p>
                <p class="text-entry">I thought the article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f" target="_blank"><em>Best Practices for Form Design</em></a> was a very insightful read. I learned more about better ways to design forms to increase user usage and better user experience. For instance, one thing that stood out to me was the inline labels and that it is best to not have the labels inside the input field but on top of them. This also applies to placeholder text which was really interesting to learn as I noticed for forms I have filled out before they tend to follow these practices. Another aspect which I thought was very important was the tab ready section. It highlights the importance of accessibility and making the form inputs easy to navigate which is good for accessibility.</p>

                <img src="images/webflow-invoice.png" alt="screenshot of webflow invoice form" width="" height="">

                <p>An example website that I think explimifies these practices is <a href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank">Webflow</a>, more specifically their invoice section under the billing section for one's website. For instance, the form displays labels above the input field with addition to providing support text next to those input fields to give users information on why Webflow needs/uses the information. I can specifically see this with the "Text notifications when payments fail" part as the support text reassures the user that Webflow will not share the user's phone number and only use their number for payment fail notifications.</p>
